About versions, you need to check in the `component.json` file.

## Install

It's a composer template, to install it you just need to launch `composer install`.

## Test

Start by creating your test file in the `test` folder and the associated code inside `src`, then launch tests and start to do TDD.

```shell
composer test
```

> Tests also collect coverage inside `coverage` folder.
